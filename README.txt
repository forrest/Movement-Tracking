Movement Tracking Test=======

This is an experiment I've written to test a number of things. It connects to the ISight camera on my Apple laptop. It then uses the graphics card to run the collected images through a series of custom filters.

USAGE:

You should be able to open the project in XCode, and hit "Build and Go". Use the 2 sliders to try and maximize the details of the moving objects in the frame. I usual focus on a moving hand.

NOTE: I've only tested this application on a MacBookPro and a MacBook. This is very alpha-level code.
